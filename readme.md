DOCS: list the documentation required for the first delivery of the project.

EXE: count the program's executables, drivers and tests. It is on this troba l'executable of the Main.

FONTS: contains all the project's program files.

----COM COMPILE I EXECUTE----

To run the program you will first need to unzip the zip. You will then need to open the terminal and execute the following:

To execute the program with the fitxer auto.sh (compile and execute now) I have to execute the command ./auto.sh, in case it does not work, I have to donate permissions if it is possible to use it.

Execute the command chmod +x auto.sh, in the /FONTS directory and execute chmod +x make.sh, to give permissions to the make.sh archive, and execute it in ./make.sh. Lastly, access the EXE directory (execute cd ../EXE from the FONTS directory) and give us permissions to chmod +x Main.sh. Now that we can execute the program, we do not allow all the .sh archives to have, therefore, we can execute the command ./Main.sh to see our application.  The auto.sh file also works if the user executes access to the main directory (cd .. if you enter EXE) and execute ./auto.sh.

---- HOW TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM ----

To test the application, there is a password created by the user: “Delivery3” and the password “123”. Here we have different keyboards created from different alphabets, we created to have more than one keyboard for each alphabet and distribution.

If you try the zero application again, create a new user and try all the functionalities that are common, or follow the testing instructions.

To better understand the operation of the application, read the User Manual.
